The job of course coordinator is important, but almost totally undefined.

This document tries to define it.

Please feel free to make pull requests against this document, and please
understand that for now, all of this is just my opinion (John Clements).

Broadly speaking, the job of the course coordinator is to supervise a
given course, ensuring that the course is taught in a way that ensures
that students in the course are well-educated and well-prepared for
follow-on courses (if there are any).

As part of this, the course coordinator is responsible for maintaining
the course ECO (Extended Course Outline), a document that describes the
learning objectives (or are those outcomes?) of the course.

The course coordinator is also notified of who's going to be teaching
the given course, at least when I remember to run the script. Should be
about 10 weeks before the start of the quarter. Or something.

Some course coordinators, especially in lower-level courses, prepare
final exams to be used by all sections of the course. In my opinion,
this is a Good Idea, and provides a basic focal point for similarity in
course outcomes. Note, however, that preparing these late in the quarter
can lead to general unhappiness; you have been warned.

Have I forgotten things? Almost certainly, yes.
